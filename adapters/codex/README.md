# Codex Adapter

OpenAI Codex uses `AGENTS.md` as its entry point by default.

## Setup

No additional files needed. Just copy:

1. `.ai/` folder to your project
2. `AGENTS.md` to your project root
3. Create `.ai-local/` and add to `.gitignore`

## Usage

Codex will read `AGENTS.md` automatically. Use:

- `/boot` - Start session
- `/save` - Save session

## Reference

See `AGENTS.md` for full documentation.
